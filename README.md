# Java Journey

**J**ava Journey is a personal learning project that documents my journey of starting from scratch with Java and gradually improving my skills. This repository contains code examples, exercises, and notes as I learn Java from the basics to more advanced concepts.

## üöÄ Project Purpose

**T**he purpose of this repository is to track my progress as I learn Java, starting from basic syntax and moving towards object-oriented programming and more advanced topics. I aim to document key concepts, challenges, and projects throughout this learning journey.

## üìö Learning Path

**T**his repository will cover the following topics:

- **Basic Syntax**: variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- **Collections & Data Structures**: lists, sets, maps, queues, etc.
- **Exception Handling**: try-catch blocks, custom exceptions
- **File I/O**: reading and writing files
- **Multithreading**: threads, synchronization
- **Projects**: hands-on projects to reinforce concepts

## üõ† Tools Used

- **Java SE (Standard Edition)**: The core Java programming language
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA (the preferred IDE for writing and running Java code)
- **Version Control**: Git (used for version control and collaboration)
